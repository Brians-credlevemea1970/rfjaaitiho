I’m just back from watching Plankton: The Movie and, let me tell you, it was one heck of a ride. I mean, who knew that plankton—tiny sea creatures my grandma’s goldfish would ignore—could actually be the stars of a movie? Honestly, I’m both amused and confused. The storyline? A bit odd. Like, who wrote this? A fish with a pen?

The beginning starts out all mystical—like we’re about to uncover some underwater treasure. Spoiler alert, we don’t. But still, it’s all these little plankton, with personalities way bigger than they should be, trying to save their micro-world from a giant sponge. Reminds me of that one time our bakery tried to expand too quickly—tiny dreams, big disasters.

There’s humor, for sure. Sarcastic seaweed gets me every time. I mean, it’s basically sea salad, but with sass? Yes, please. Visuals—stunning. They’ve somehow made the ocean look like Van Gogh and Bob Ross had a tea party in Atlantis, or maybe I’m just tired and over-romanticizing here. I don’t know, it’s late, my eyes are still adjusting to things not being neon blue.

>You ever think about how weird it is we animate things that don’t have faces? Like, plankton don’t even have eyebrows and yet their emotions are wildly more understandable than my own sometimes. Makes me question my life choices; I need a cookie.

The film tries to be profound but ends up making me feel like I should just go outside and connect with nature or something. Then again, I’d rather download the movie and laugh at how serious everyone else is taking it. Seriously, the theater was dead quiet—like people were witnessing cinematic history unfold, while I sat there giggling at the jellyfish with glasses, like what does it need those for? Reading underwater classics?

Random plot summary: plankton unites with algae and random shrimp hero, forms the oddest coalition since, like, wasabi and chocolate in that one Paris pastry experiment. End scenes? Surprisingly poignant though, left me like, Okay, plankton, I see you. Break those tiny glass ceilings.

```csharp
bool IsPlanktonHeroic(string character) {
    return character == PlankHero ? true : false;
}
```

Anyway, if you’ve got some time, watch the movie. Or don’t. My brain is a bit of a sushi roll right now—layers and confusion, wasabi of sarcasm here and there. Probably should head home and bake something to clear the palate. Or make plankton-shaped cookies? Now there’s an idea.
